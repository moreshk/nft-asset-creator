    "description": "Auric Melodius Sparklestrum, a mischievous female gnome, was born into a family of traveling performers. As a child, she quickly learned the art of deception and entertainment. However, it was her innate musical talent that truly set her apart. Using her enchanting voice and captivating melodies, Auric would often mesmerize unsuspecting audiences, her silver tongue spinning tales of wonder and enchantment. With her trusty nightcap, which granted her soothing dreams, she set off on her own, eager to explore the world and share her music with all who would listen. Driven by a desire to bring joy and excitement to those she meets, Auric roams the land as a bard, embracing her chaotic good nature",
