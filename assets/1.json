    "description": "Thrumble Cragjaw, a charismatic gnome with wild, unkempt hair resembling the tangled branches of his forest home, spent his childhood among the creatures of the wilderness. One fateful day, he discovered an old divination card bearing his likeness, and it sparked a burning desire within him to uncover the secrets of his fate. Leaving behind his peaceful life as an Outlander, Thrumble ventured out into the world as a Barbarian, driven by his insatiable curiosity and a need to unlock the mysteries of the card's prophecy. With a heart full of chaotic good, Thrumble now roams the land, drawing strength from the untamed forces of nature, as he seeks to unravel the enigma that is his own destiny",
