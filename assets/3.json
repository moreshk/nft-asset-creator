    "description": "Erevan Shadowstep, a Half-Elf Monk, was born into a military family in the Elven Kingdom of Arvandor. With a natural inclination towards combat and discipline, he followed in his parents' footsteps and joined the military as a Soldier. However, during a crucial battle against the forces of evil, Erevan witnessed the devastating consequences of war and decided to leave the military behind to seek a path of peace and justice.\n\nGuided by his elven heritage and his monk training, Erevan embarked on a spiritual journey across the realm, honing his martial arts skills and seeking enlightenment. Along his travels, he encountered various allies and foes, each teaching him valuable lessons about compassion, understanding, and the balance between justice",
